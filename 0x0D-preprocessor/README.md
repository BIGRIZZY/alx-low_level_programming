# Preprocessor
Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX**. It aims to learn about how to include guard in the header files and macros in **C language**.

## Technologies
* C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

## Files
All of the following files are programs written in C:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-object_like_macro.h` | Header file that defines a macro named `SIZE` |
| `1-pi.h` | Header file that defines a macro named `PI` |
| `2-main.c` | Prints the name of the file it was compiled from |
| `3-function_like_macro.h` | Function-like macro `ABS(x)` that computes the absolute value of a number `x` |
| `4-sum.h` | Function-like macro `SUM(x,y)` that computes the sum of the numbers `x` and `y` |
